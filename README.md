# COVID-19 Test Result prediction

This project aims to use a subset of the Ontario COVID-19 test results dataset to model, predict and compare the results using tree-based ensemble and Naive Bayes methods. The files are self explanatory and the dataset is also uploaded. The Jupyter notebook has in-detail analysis and observations in accordance with the code.
